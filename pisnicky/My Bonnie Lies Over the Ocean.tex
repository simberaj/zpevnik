Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
Last night as I lay on my pillow
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead

The winds have blown over the ocean
The winds have blown over the sea
The winds have blown over the ocean
And brought back my Bonnie to me

My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank
The height of its contents to see
I lit a small match to assist her
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me

Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
I stuck my feet out of the window
In the morning the neighbors were dead

I tried making beer in the bathtub
I tried making synthetic gin
I tried making fudge for a living
Now look at the shape that I'm in
