\[Em]{I walk} a \[G]lonely road

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps

\[C]My \[G]shadow's \[D]only one that \[Em]walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's screwed up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone
I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk a-
