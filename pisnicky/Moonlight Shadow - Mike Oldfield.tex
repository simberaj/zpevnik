The \[Am]last that ever she \[F]saw him

He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

\[C]Lost in a riddle that \[G]Saturday night
\[Am]{Far a}\[F]way on the \[G]other side

He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watch your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
The stars move slowly in a silvery light
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
