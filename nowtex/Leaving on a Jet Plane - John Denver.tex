All my \[G]bags are packed~-- I'\[C]{m ready} to go
I'm \[G]standing here out\[C]side your door
I \[G]hate to wake you \[C]{up to} say good\[D]bye

But the dawn is breaking ~-- it's early morn
The taxi's waitin'~-- he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
\cl
\chor
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe I hate to go
\cl
\num
There's is many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I think of you
Every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring
\fin

\num
Now the time's come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes~-- I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say
