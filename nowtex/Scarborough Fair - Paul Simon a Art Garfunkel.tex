Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seems nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine
\fin\num
Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she'll be a true love of mine
\fin\num
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine
