Come \[G]gather round \[Em]people whe\[C]rever you \[G]roam
And admit that the \[C]waters a\[D]round you have grown
And ac\[G]cept it that \[Em]soon you'll be \[C]drenched to the \[G]bone
If your time to \[Am]{you is} worth \[D]saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a \[D]stone
For the \[G]times \[C]they are a-\[D]chan\[G]ging

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changing

Come senators congressmen please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside and it's raging
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your halls
For the times they are a-changing
\fin
\num
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you don't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old role is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changing

\num
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changing
