Oh Johnny, did you miss me when the nights were long and cold
Or did you find another love in your arms to hold?
Says he, I thought of only you while on the sea afar
So come up the stairs and cuddle with your jolly roving tar

Well in each other's arms they rolled till the break of day
When the sailor rose and said farewell, I must be on me way
Ah don't you leave me Johnny lad, I thought you'd marry me
Says he I can't be married for I'm married to the sea

Well come all you bonnie lasses now, a warning take by me
And never trust an Irishman an inch above your knee
He'll tease you and he'll squeeze you and when he's had his fun
He'll leave you in the morning with a daughter or a son
